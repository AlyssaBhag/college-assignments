      * BONUS CALCULATION BASED ON SALES
      * -------------------------------

      * Determine if bonus applies based on sales amount

           if il-sales > ws-sales-threshold
      * Call a procedure to handle commission with bonus
                perform 400-sales-gtr-threshold
      * Mark this person as having received a bonus
                move ws-bonus-yes to ws-bonus-status
                add 1 to ws-num-earned-bonus

           else

      * Call a procedure to handle normal commission
                perform 500-sales-less-threshold
      * Mark this person as having no bonus
                move ws-no-bonus to ws-bonus-status
                add 1 to ws-num-no-bonus
           end-if.

      * -------------------------------
      * BONUS + COMMISSION CALCULATION
      * -------------------------------
       400-sales-gtr-threshold.

      * Compute commission + bonus:
      * (sales * rate) + bonus for extra sales over threshold
           compute ws-earned-calc rounded
                = il-sales * il-rate / 100
                + (il-sales - ws-sales-threshold)
                * ws-bonus-rate.

      * If calculated amount is more than the allowed max, cap it
           if ws-earned-calc > il-max
                move il-max                 to ws-paid-calc
                add 1                       to ws-over-max
           else
                move ws-earned-calc         to ws-paid-calc
                add 1                       to ws-num-paid-equal-earned 
           end-if.

      * ------------------------
      * COMMISSION CALCULATION
      * -------------------------
       500-sales-less-threshold.
      * Calculate regular commission without bonus

      * Ensure minimum payment is met
           if ws-earned-calc < il-min
                move il-min to ws-paid-calc
                add 1 to ws-under-min
           else
                move ws-earned-calc to ws-paid-calc
                add 1 to ws-num-paid-equal-earned
           end-if.
