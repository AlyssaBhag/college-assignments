      * Transportation Charge Based on Product Class

      * NOTES (This helps explain without showing the whole code).
      * ----------------------------------------------------------
      * Apply transportation charge based on product class:
      * - Class A: Apply specific transport rate and calculate charge based on extended price
      * - Class D: Apply a different transport rate and calculate charge
      * - Class F: Apply another transport rate for transport calculation
      * - Other products: Apply lower or flat transport rate based on quantity


      if il-product-class = ws-class-trans-A then
      * Apply transport percentage for class A
           move ws-transport-per-A to ws-transportation-perc
      * Calculate transport charge for class A
           multiply 0.155 by ws-extended-calc
                giving ws-trans-charge-calc rounded
      else
      * Apply transport percentage for class D
      * Calculate transport charge for class D

      else
      * Apply transport percentage for class F
      * Calculate transport charge for class F


      else
      * For non-transport products, calculate lower transport rate
      * Calculate lower transport charge

      else
      * For large quantities, apply flat transport rate

           end-if.
