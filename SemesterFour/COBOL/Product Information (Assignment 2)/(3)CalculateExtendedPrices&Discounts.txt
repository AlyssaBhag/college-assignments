      * Calculation of Extended Price and Discounts
      * --------------------------

      * NOTES (This helps explain without showing the whole code).
      * ----------------------------------------------------------
      * Apply discount based on product class and conditions:
      * - For classes A and F, apply discount if extended price meets threshold
      * - For class B, apply discount if quantity is greater than 100
      * - Otherwise, no discount is applied and increment the count of items without discount

      if il-product-class = ws-class-discount-A and
           ws-extended-calc > 200 or
      il-product-class = ws-class-discount-F and
           ws-extended-calc > 1000

      * Calculate discount for applicable product classes (A or F)
      * (Discount percentage multiplied by extended price)

      else
      * Apply discount for class B if quantity > 100

           else
       * No discount for other cases.

           end-if
