# Semester Four Repository

Welcome to my **SemesterFour** repository! 📚💻 This repo showcases projects from my fourth semester, focusing on **CSS-based web development** and **COBOL programming**.

## 📌 Projects Overview

### 🏛 COBOL Assignments
This section showcases selected COBOL assignments, demonstrating:
- Key concepts and structured programming techniques.
- Includes images of reports generated from the assignments.
- *(Note: None of the entire assignments are included to uphold academic integrity.)*

### 🎮 OOP Game Project (*Journey of the Goblin Slayer*)
An action-packed 2D shooter inspired by *Journey of the Prairie King* from Stardew Valley:
- Developed using **Unity and C#** with object-oriented programming principles.
- Features include **wave-based combat**, modular weapon systems, dynamic perks, and intelligent enemy AI.
- Implements **real-time event handling** for responsive gameplay mechanics.
- Integrated **backend database** for persistent player data, high score tracking, and configurable game settings.
- Demonstrates advanced object-oriented programming concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns.

### 🛠 Web Development Projects

Both web projects share a foundational approach, utilizing similar technologies while serving distinct purposes:

#### 🐾 Animal Database Website (inft-2202-ice)
A dynamic website designed to manage animal records efficiently:
- Add, delete, and update entries within a database.
- Built using **Webpack, Local Storage, EJS, Express, and API calls**.
- Implements **middleware** for processing requests and robust **error handling**.

#### 🎮 Vintage Games Store Website (inft-2202-lab)
An interactive store interface for tracking game inventory:
- Displays available and out-of-stock games while supporting inventory updates.
- Utilizes **Express, Local Storage, API interactions, and Middleware** for smooth functionality.
- Features stock management tools for adding, deleting, and modifying records.
