                <p class="lead">Hi! My name is Alyssa Bhagwandin</p>
                <p> I was born in Canada, but my heritage is a blend of Guyanese and Indian roots. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Programming at Durham College, where I’m nurturing my passion for designing innovative solutions and creating impactful software.</p>
                <p> After graduation, I aspire to build a career as a software developer or game designer. The idea of combining creativity with technology excites me. Crafting experiences that entertain, inspire, and address real world challenges is my ultimate goal. </p>
