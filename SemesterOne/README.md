# PizzaPiMachine

Welcome to the first version of my **PizzaPiMachine**! üçïüî¢

This project marks the beginning of my programming journey. I created this during my first semester as an introduction to GUI development. It‚Äôs a simple but fun project that helped me grasp the basics of graphical user interfaces.

## About the Project

- **Purpose:** Learn fundamental concepts of GUI programming.
- **Language:** Initially developed python.
- **Future Iteration:** I later rewrote this program in C#, which was a nostalgic and rewarding experience.
